# Onboarding Assignment - Logger

## Description
This is a simple logger that logs messages to a file or the console.\ 
The user has an option to select whether to use the singleton pattern or not.\  
Using the getLogger method uses the singleton pattern, while using the constructor is not.\

The logger has 4 levels of logging:
- DEBUG
- INFO
- WARNING
- ERROR

When logging to a file, need to use the logging as an asynchronous function and use await before the function.

The logger comes with a test suite that tests the logger's functionality.
